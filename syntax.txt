socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM):

socket.AF_INET: This specifies the address family, meaning the script is using IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4).
socket.SOCK_STREAM: This defines the socket type, indicating that the connection will use TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), which ensures reliable, ordered, and error-checked communication.


s.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1):

socket.SOL_SOCKET: This is a socket-level option, meaning the option being set applies to the socket itself.
socket.SO_REUSEADDR: This allows the socket to reuse a local address (IP + port) without waiting for a timeout after the socket is closed. It's useful for restarting a server immediately after it was stopped.
1: This is the boolean value enabling the SO_REUSEADDR option (where 1 means True).
