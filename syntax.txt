socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM):

socket.AF_INET: This specifies the address family, meaning the script is using IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4).
socket.SOCK_STREAM: This defines the socket type, indicating that the connection will use TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), which ensures reliable, ordered, and error-checked communication.


s.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1):

socket.SOL_SOCKET: This is a socket-level option, meaning the option being set applies to the socket itself.
socket.SO_REUSEADDR: This allows the socket to reuse a local address (IP + port) without waiting for a timeout after the socket is closed. It's useful for restarting a server immediately after it was stopped.
1: This is the boolean value enabling the SO_REUSEADDR option (where 1 means True).
-------

proc = subprocess.Popen(command, shell=True, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE, stdin=subprocess.PIPE)

shell=True: Runs the command inside a shell, which allows things like piping (|) and wildcard expansion (*). But be careful—it can be risky if command comes from user input (risk of shell injection).
stdout=subprocess.PIPE: Captures the standard output (stdout) of the process. This allows Python to read the command’s output instead of printing it directly.
stderr=subprocess.PIPE: Captures the standard error (stderr), meaning if the command fails, its error message won't be lost.
stdin=subprocess.PIPE: Allows sending input to the process, useful when the command expects user interaction.

result = proc.stdout.read() + proc.stderr.read()
proc.stdout.read(): Reads everything that the command outputs (standard output).
proc.stderr.read(): Reads any error messages (standard error).
+: Combines both outputs into one variable (result), so you can see both the success output and any errors together.
